## chesshook

userscript for chess.com that highlights hanging pieces and attempts to calculate the best move.

the [engine](https://github.com/Strryke/betafish) can beat the highest rated named free bot on chess.com (Francis, 2300 elo), but struggles against the engine set to 2500 elo.

i use violentmonkey on firefox as my userscript manager. not tested on another browser.

### soon:
lichess.org support, i just need to figure out the highlighting/arrows and grabbing the FEN string
