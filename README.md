## Chesshook

Userscript for chess.com

## Usage:
 - Install a userscript manager, such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/).
 - Create a new script with the content of: [chesshook.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0mlml/chesshook/master/chesshook.user.js)
   - Navigate to chess.com
   - Note: The hotkey to toggle the window is Alt+K, but it should render by default

## Features:
 - Highlight hanging pieces
 - Autoqueue
   - Automatically begins a queue for a new game after the current game ends
 - Engine integration
   - Includes a few native engines, but can also use any UCI-compliant engine using [this](https://github.com/0mlml/chesshook-intermediary)
   - Renders a green arrow on the board to indicate the best move
 - Automove
   - Plays the best move generated by the selected engine
   - Has a minimum and maximum move time; try to play the move within that time range
     - Setting max to 0 will move instantly when the engine has a move
   - Is detected by the client as 'didUseCheatMouse', but that does not appear to produce a ban
     - I have been banned once, but only after letting an account play for 700 games in a row
 - Legit mode
   - Disables the engine and automove features
 - Bot game exploits
   - 'Force Bot Scholars Mate': Will force the bot to play scholars mate, counts as defeating the bot for the crowns
   - 'Force Draw Against Bot': Will force the bot to agree to draw

### Engines:
 - [Betafish](https://github.com/Strryke/betafish), can beat the highest rated named free bot on chess.com (Francis, 2300 elo)
 - [Random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random), plays a random legal move
 - [Checkmate, Check, Capture, Push](http://tom7.org/chess/weak.pdf), inspired by Tom7's paper for SIGBOVIK 2019, not very good at chess
 - [External](https://github.com/0mlml/chesshook-intermediary), can use any UCI-compliant engine using an intermediary server written in Golang

### Soon:
 - [ ] Lichess.org support
 - [X] Automatically playing the best move
 - [X] Offloading engine to webworker
 - [X] Full automation of matchmaking (finding games, etc.)
