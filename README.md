## chesshook

userscript for chess.com that highlights hanging pieces and attempts to calculate the best move.

the engine can beat the highest rated named free bot on chess.com (Francis, 2300 elo), but struggles against the engine set to 2500 elo.

### soon:
lichess.org support, i just need to figure out the highlighting/arrows and grabbing the FEN string
